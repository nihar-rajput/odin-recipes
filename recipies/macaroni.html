        <h3>Steps to Make Macaroni and Cheese:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Macaroni:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook according to the package instructions (usually 8-10 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Once done, drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make the Cheese Sauce:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for about 1 minute to form a roux.</li>
                    <li>Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens (about 3-5 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Stir in the cheddar cheese and Parmesan until melted and smooth.</li>
                    <li>Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and mustard powder if using.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Combine:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until the pasta is well coated.</li>
                    <li>If the sauce is too thick, you can add a bit more milk to reach your desired consistency.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve immediately as a creamy, cheesy dish. You can also top it with breadcrumbs and bake it for a crispy crust if desired.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
