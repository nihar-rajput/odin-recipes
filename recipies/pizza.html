    <h3>Steps to Make Pizza:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pizza dough:
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and sprinkle the yeast on top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rise for about 1-1.5 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix the canned tomato sauce, oregano, garlic powder, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or as hot as your oven allows for optimal pizza baking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Shape the dough:
            <ul>
                <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a floured surface. Roll it out into a thin round shape (about 12 inches in diameter).</li>
                <li>Place the dough onto a greased pizza pan or a baking sheet.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the pizza:
            <ul>
                <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add any other toppings you like, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.</li>
                <li>Finish by sprinkling grated Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bake the pizza:
            <ul>
                <li>Drizzle a little olive oil around the crust for a golden finish.</li>
                <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and the crust is golden brown.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven. Add fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
                <li>Slice and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
