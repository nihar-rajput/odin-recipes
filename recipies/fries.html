        <h3>Description:</h3>

They’re often served as a side dish with burgers, sandwiches, or on their own with a variety of dipping sauces. Whether you prefer thin, crispy fries or thick-cut steak fries, this dish is a simple yet satisfying favorite.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients for French Fries:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>4 large russet potatoes (or any potatoes suitable for frying)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Optional seasonings (paprika, garlic powder, pepper, or herbs)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Steps to Make French Fries:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Potatoes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Peel the potatoes if desired (you can leave the skin on for a rustic feel).</li>
                    <li>Cut the potatoes into even strips, about ¼ to ½ inch thick, to ensure even frying.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Soak the Potatoes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Soak the cut fries in a large bowl of water for at least 30 minutes (this helps to remove excess starch and results in crispier fries).</li>
                    <li>After soaking, drain the fries and pat them dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Heat the Oil:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a deep fryer or large pot, heat the vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C). You need enough oil to fully submerge the fries.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fry the Potatoes (First Frying):
                <ul>
                    <li>Carefully add a handful of fries into the hot oil and fry them for about 3-4 minutes until they are soft but not golden yet.</li>
                    <li>Remove the fries from the oil and let them rest on paper towels.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Second Frying (for Crispiness):
                <ul>
                    <li>Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>Return the fries to the hot oil in batches, frying for another 2-3 minutes until they turn golden brown and crispy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Drain and Season:
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove the fries from the oil and drain them on paper towels. Immediately sprinkle with salt (or your favorite seasoning).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve your fries hot, with your favorite dipping sauce (ketchup, mayo, or aioli).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
